# responsive-nft-site
A fun NFT-themed static webpage built to practice CSS layout, Flexbox, flex-wrap, and responsive design using media queries.

This project is a playful NFT-themed landing page built with just HTML and CSS. The main focus was to improve my front-end styling skills, particularly:

-Flexbox layout and alignment

-Using flex-wrap for wrapping items on smaller screens

-Responsive design with media queries

-Clean and readable structure with semantic HTML

-Styling with consistent spacing, typography, and border-radius

It has no JavaScript and no interactivity â€” just pure front-end styling practice. The design adapts to different screen sizes, and the layout maintains visual appeal across breakpoints. This was a great exercise in applying modern CSS layout techniques.
